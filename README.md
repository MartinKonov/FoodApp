## FoodApp
---------------------

Often I find myself in a situation, where I have a lot of different ingredients in my fridge, but i don't know what to do with them, so I made a simple app, designed to give me ideas for different recipes!

Here is how it works:  

After downloading the Release and running the .exe file, on the desktop you will have this shortcut:

Clicking it will open the home page:

Here you can select the amount of ingredients that you have lying around in your fridge. A few new boxes will appear, where you can enter the names of your products. For example:

After clicking enter, the app will give you 10 recipes, that can be made with your ingredients:

Here you can scan the recipes by name and open whichever catches your eye! For example, let's say I like the Charlotte Potato Salad:

Here you get an image of how it looks, a short summary, what additional ingredients you may need and detailed instructions of how the recipe is prepared!
Also if you are tracking macronutrients, below the instructions you can see the exact amount of calories, protein, carbs and fats per serving.

If this information is not enough for you, you can also click the link below the macronutrients, to open an even more detailed page in your browser, for this particular recipe!
